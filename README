I went through these steps to create this program:

1.) I first made a large while loop called "BigLoop" that runs through my switch statements until the entered command is "EXIT" and input is given. 

2.) I next made my switch statement. Originally, I was making this in C++, but it became kind of a nightmare because switch statements in C++ only accept case names at characters of integers. Considering how string heavy this assignment was, I switched over to Java. 

3.) All special cases, such as firefighters and police are taken under the "TURN" case. 

4.) I used a variable called "doorOpen" to keep track of if the door was unlocked (true) or locked (false). 

5.) People in the house was kept track of using an amended string variable "inHouse".
